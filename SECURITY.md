## Reporting a Bug

The CMP RA Component team and community
take all security bugs in CMP RA Component serious.
Thank you for improving the security of CMP RA Component.
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and
will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please report security bugs
by emailing the lead maintainer via `Andreas.Kretschmer@siemens.com`.

The lead maintainer will usually acknowledge your email within 48 hours,
and will usually send a more detailed response within 48 hours
indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to those responsible for them.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance.
    These fixes will be released as fast as possible to npm.
