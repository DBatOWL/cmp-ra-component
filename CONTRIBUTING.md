## Pull Request Process

Please use the [Forking Workflow]
(https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)
and send us Pull Requests.

1. Update the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)
   and as far as appropriate also the [README](README.md)
   with details of changes and updates of functions and interfaces.
2. Increase the version number in pom.xml
   to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
   The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
3. You may merge a Pull Request in
   once you have the sign-off of two other developers,
   or if you do not have permission to do that,
   you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
